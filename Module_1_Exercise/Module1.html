                JavaScript was created in 1995 as a language to allow \
                non programmers to create interactive web sites. It was \
                created as a collaboration between Netscape Navigator, \
                Sun Microsystems, and Brendan Eich. Orginally Netscape \
                hoped to embed Java and Scheme into Netscape Navigator \
                but they quickly realized that it was best to implement \
                a new programming language. In 1996 Netscape began to \
                standardize the JavaScript language when they submitted \
                it to Ecma International. The first ECMAScript was \
                released in 1997.";
