    HTML and CSS attributes. It can also calculate, manipulate, and \
    validate data. While HTML is used to define content of a web page \
    and CSS is used to specify the layout of the page, JavaScript is \

        Major libraries include jQuery, Angular, Bootsrap, and many \
        others. About 80% of all websites use third party libraries but \
        some 'Vanilla' websites rely soley on standard JavaScript. Other \
        projects include both client-side and server side projects such as \
        Electorn, Cordova, and React Native as well as Adobe Acrobat PDF \
        scripting and GNOME Shell extensions. Much of this was made possible \
        by using Node.js to run JavaScript outside the browser environment.";
