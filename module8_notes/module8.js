// Asynchronous JavaScript, Events, and Timing
// Last of client side JS
// Next week we'll work on server side JS
// Events & Timing and Asynchronous JS are related
// FetchAPI is a method of asyhronous JS

// Timing:
// ASynch JS can be used for timing events using a time
// After you set at timer, the script will run on its own.
// Two methods:
// setTimeout(function, milliseconds) = executes a function after a number of ms
// setInterval(function, milliseconds) = repeats the function continuously every interval
// Repeats like a timed loop.
// Each function returns a reference to the timer.

// clearTimeout(timeoutVariable) 
// clears the timer so that the timer. Uses the variable 
// returned by the reference returned by the setTimeout and setInterval
// functions

// clearInterval() 
// Stops the interval so the script stops running

// DOM Events
// JS can respond to events that happen in the document itself
// onMouseover and onClick are examples.
// Can be supplied to html elements as attributes.
// Other Examples:
// When a user clicks the mouse
// when a web page has loaded
// when an image has been loaded
// when the mouse moves over an element
// when an input field is changed
// when an html form is submitted
// when user strokes a key
