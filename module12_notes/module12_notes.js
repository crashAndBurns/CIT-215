// Module 12 - RESTful APIs
// 4/7/2025

// WEb based database interaction tool
// Node + express + database + REST API
// routes correspond to accessing or submitting data
// Popular databases include SQL and NOSQL

// NOSQL uses JSON to pass data back and forth.
// REST API tends to be a  series of endpoints.
// GET https://foo.com/players/ <--- returns a List of all players
// GET https://foo.com/players/1234 <--- returns data of player 1234
// POST http://foo.com/players/new <--- ALlows creating of a new player
// PUT/PATCH http://foo.com/players/1234 <--- Edits existing player data
// DELETE http://foo.com/players/1234 <--- deletes the particular player
// all they do is give/accept JSON data and what they do depends
// on the http request.

// what do we use as a front end?
// CURL works but most people don't want to use it.
// Could use a separate front end.
// Node + express + REACT front end that ties into the backend.
// Python library/application that ties into the backend.
// Mobile App that uses the backend.

// backend runs headless that runs a server on an ip address.
// uses the http transfer protocol. Then you create the app you want
// to use the api backend.

// you can build a REST API with any language that handles http servers
// and responds to the rest endpoints.
